Implement Linear regression in python from scratch using only numpy.

## Profit prediction using Linear Regression with one variable.

A restaurant has trucks in various cities and has collecetd data of profits and populations from the cities. I have used Linear Regression on this data to help select which city to expand to next.

#### Dataset
The file data1.txt contains the dataset for linear regression problem. The first column is the population of a city and the second column is the profit of a food truck in that city. A negative value for profit indicates a loss.

## House Price prediction using Linear Regression with multiple variables.

I have used feature normalization and linear regression to make a model to predict housing prices.

#### Dataset
The file data2.txt contains a training set of housing prices in Portland, Oregon. The first column is the size of the house (in square feet), the second column is the number of bedrooms, and the third column is the price of the house.
